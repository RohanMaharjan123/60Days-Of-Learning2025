# 60Days-Of-Learning2025

Welcome to my 60-day learning journey as part of the **LSPP Leapfrog 60 Days of Learning Challenge**!

My motto for this challenge: **60 Days, 60 Lessons.** Let's see what I discover!

## About This Challenge

This repository documents my progress, notes, and projects as I explore new topics and deepen my understanding of various technologies over the next 60 days. Each day will focus on a specific lesson or concept.

---

## My Goals

* To learn something new each day for 60 days.
* To build and maintain a consistent learning habit.
* To explore various technologies and concepts that pique my interest.
* To document my progress and reflections along the way.
