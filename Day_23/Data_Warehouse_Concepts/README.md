## 🧠 What I Learned

### 🗂️ What is a Data Warehouse?

A **Data Warehouse** is a central repository of integrated data from one or more sources. It stores current and historical data and is used for creating analytical reports for knowledge workers.

### 🧩 Key Features of a Data Warehouse

| Feature                | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Subject-Oriented       | Organized around key subjects (e.g., sales, customers)                     |
| Integrated             | Combines data from multiple sources                                         |
| Time-Variant           | Maintains historical data                                                   |
| Non-Volatile           | Data is stable – not updated in real-time                                  |

### 🏛️ Data Warehouse Architecture

1. **Data Source Layer** – Operational systems (ERP, CRM, files, etc.)
2. **Data Staging Layer** – ETL process to extract, clean, and load data
3. **Data Storage Layer** – Centralized warehouse (normalized or dimensional)
4. **Presentation Layer** – BI tools, dashboards, and OLAP cubes

### 🧰 Components of a Data Warehouse

- **ETL Tools** (Extract, Transform, Load)
- **Metadata Repository**
- **OLAP Engine**
- **Data Marts**
- **Reporting & Analysis Tools**

### 💡 Benefits of Data Warehousing

- Supports **business decision making**
- Provides **consolidated view of data**
- Enables **faster query performance**
- Improves **data quality and consistency**

## 🧪 Practice/Reflection

While hands-on practice with data warehousing often requires working with tools like:

- **SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services)**

- **Snowflake / Redshift**

- **Google BigQuery / Azure Synapse**
