## 🧠 What I Learned

### 🚀 What is SSAS?

✅ SSAS is Microsoft’s **online analytical processing (OLAP)** and **data mining** tool in SQL Server.  
✅ It enables **fast data analysis** across large datasets using **cubes and tabular models**.  
✅ Used for **business intelligence (BI) reporting and dashboarding** with tools like Power BI, SSRS, and Excel.

### ⚙️ SSAS Modes

| Mode        | Description                                                       |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Multidimensional (OLAP)** | Uses cubes for complex aggregations and drill-downs. |
| **Tabular** | Uses tables and in-memory storage (VertiPaq) for fast processing. |

### 🗂️ SSAS Architecture Components

**Data Source** – Connects to relational databases for source data.  
**Data Source View (DSV)** – Logical layer defining relationships between tables.  
**Cube/Model** – Structure that organizes data for analysis with measures and dimensions.  
**Dimensions** – Qualitative data categories (e.g., Product, Region, Time).  
**Measures** – Quantitative data (e.g., Sales Amount, Quantity).  
**Processing** – Loads data into cubes/models for analysis.  
**Deployment** – Deploys the model to the SSAS server for querying by BI tools.

### 💡 Why SSAS?

- Enables **advanced data analysis** using aggregations and KPIs.  
- Provides **drill-down, slice-and-dice** analysis on large data.  
- Integrated with **Power BI and Excel** for seamless reporting.  
- Increases **query performance** using pre-aggregated data in cubes.

---

## 🛠️ Practice Plan

- Installed **SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)** for SSAS.  
- Connected to a sample database (e.g., AdventureWorks).  
- Designed a basic cube:
- Dimensions: Product, Date, Geography.
- Measures: Sales Amount, Quantity.

- Deployed the cube to **SSAS server** and processed it.  
- Queried the cube using **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** and Excel PivotTables.

## Example MDX Query (Multidimensional Expressions)

```sql
SELECT 
  [Measures].[Sales Amount] ON COLUMNS,
  [Date].[Calendar Year].MEMBERS ON ROWS
FROM [Sales]
WHERE ([Geography].[Country].[United States])
```

Key Takeaways

- SSAS is a core tool for OLAP and advanced analytics in the MSBI stack.
- Cubes and tabular models improve data analysis performance.
- Ideal for enterprise-level reporting and BI dashboards.
- Helps in building data-driven decision-making systems.
