## Topic: SQL Server Backup and Restore

Today, I learned how to back up and restore databases in SQL Server using T-SQL commands. These are critical operations to ensure data safety, system recovery, and migration.

## üß† What I Learned

### üì¶ Backup Types in SQL Server

| Backup Type     | Description                                              |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Full Backup     | Complete backup of the database                          |
| Differential    | Changes since the last full backup                       |
| Transaction Log | Backup of all changes since the last log backup          |

## üß™ Practice Examples

> ‚úÖ **FULL BACKUP**

```sql
-- Create full backup of TestDB
BACKUP DATABASE TestDB
TO DISK = 'C:\Backups\TestDB_Full.bak'
WITH FORMAT, INIT, NAME = 'Full Backup of TestDB';
```

>‚úÖ **DIFFERENTIAL BACKUP**

```sql
-- Create differential backup
BACKUP DATABASE TestDB
TO DISK = 'C:\Backups\TestDB_Diff.bak'
WITH DIFFERENTIAL, NAME = 'Diff Backup of TestDB';
```

> ‚úÖ **TRANSACTION LOG BACKUP**

```sql
-- Backup transaction log
BACKUP LOG TestDB
TO DISK = 'C:\Backups\TestDB_Log.trn'
WITH NOFORMAT, INIT, NAME = 'Log Backup';
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **RESTORE WITH NORECOVERY (For chaining restores)**

```sql
-- Restore for applying diff or logs after
RESTORE DATABASE TestDB
FROM DISK = 'C:\Backups\TestDB_Full.bak'
WITH NORECOVERY;
```
