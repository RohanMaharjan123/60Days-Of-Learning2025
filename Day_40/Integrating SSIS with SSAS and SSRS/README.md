## üß† What I Learned

### üóÇÔ∏è Overview of MSBI Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **SSIS (Integration Services)** | ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data from various sources into the data warehouse. |
| **SSAS (Analysis Services)** | Create OLAP cubes or Tabular models for advanced analytics. |
| **SSRS (Reporting Services)** | Generate and deliver reports and dashboards to end users. |

### ‚öôÔ∏è Integration Workflow

**1Ô∏è‚É£ SSIS ‚Üí SSAS**

- Use SSIS to **load and transform data** into the data warehouse.
- After ETL, trigger **SSAS cube processing** using the `Analysis Services Processing Task` in SSIS to refresh cubes automatically.

**2Ô∏è‚É£ SSAS ‚Üí SSRS**

- SSRS can use **SSAS cubes as data sources** for building dynamic, analytical reports.
- Enables users to **slice, dice, and drill down data** in reports.

**3Ô∏è‚É£ SSIS ‚Üí SSRS**

- SSIS can load data directly to reporting tables used by SSRS for reports.
- SSIS can also **trigger report subscriptions** via scripts if needed.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Integration Tasks in SSIS

**Analysis Services Processing Task**  

- Automates SSAS cube refresh after ETL load completion.

**Data Flow Task**  

- Load data into warehouse tables used by SSAS for cube processing.

**Execute SQL Task**  

- Control flow for preparing data or logging report delivery status.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Practice Plan

- Created a **simple ETL pipeline using SSIS** to load sales data.  
- Added an **Analysis Services Processing Task** to refresh the `SalesCube` in SSAS post-load.  
- Connected SSRS to `SalesCube` to build a report showing `Sales Amount by Year and Region`.  
- Verified end-to-end workflow from **data ingestion ‚Üí cube processing ‚Üí reporting**.

---

## üí° Key Takeaways

- Integration of SSIS, SSAS, and SSRS allows **building a seamless BI workflow**.  
- **Automated cube processing** post ETL ensures up-to-date analytical data.  
- SSRS leveraging SSAS cubes enables **advanced, interactive reporting**.  
- Forms a **robust pipeline for enterprise-level business intelligence**.
