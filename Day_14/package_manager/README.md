- Understood how to install, update, uninstall, and freeze packages.
- Practiced creating and using `requirements.txt` files.
- Explored best practices for managing Python project dependencies.

### 📦 Key Concepts

| Command                            | Description                                   |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `pip install package_name`        | Installs a package from PyPI                  |
| `pip uninstall package_name`      | Uninstalls a package                          |
| `pip install -U package_name`     | Upgrades a package                            |
| `pip freeze`                      | Lists installed packages and versions         |
| `pip freeze > requirements.txt`   | Saves package list to a file                  |
| `pip install -r requirements.txt` | Installs all packages from a file             |
| `pip show package_name`           | Shows metadata about an installed package     |
| `pip list`                        | Displays all installed packages               |

### 🧠 Learning Summary

- `pip` stands for **"Pip Installs Packages"** and is the de facto tool for installing Python packages from the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/).
- Using `pip` efficiently is essential for Python development.
- A `requirements.txt` file ensures consistent environments across systems.
