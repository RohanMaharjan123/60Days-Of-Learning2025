## 🧠 What I Learned

### 🚀 What is MSBI?

**MSBI (Microsoft Business Intelligence)** is a powerful suite for **data integration, analysis, and reporting** using Microsoft tools:

**SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services)** – ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)  
**SSAS (SQL Server Analysis Services)** – Data analysis and OLAP  
**SSRS (SQL Server Reporting Services)** – Data visualization and reporting

### 🗂️ MSBI Architecture Layers

| Layer                  | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Layer**         | Raw data from various sources: SQL, flat files, cloud, APIs                |
| **Integration Layer**  | ETL with SSIS to cleanse, transform, and load data into the warehouse      |
| **Analysis Layer**     | Data analysis and modeling using SSAS with cubes and tabular models        |
| **Presentation Layer** | Reporting and visualization using SSRS and Power BI                        |

---

### ⚙️ Key Features

- Seamless integration within the Microsoft ecosystem.  
- Scalable ETL pipelines using **SSIS**.  
- Advanced data modeling with **SSAS (OLAP cubes, tabular models)**.  
- Robust reporting and subscriptions with **SSRS**.  
- Role-based security and scheduled data refresh.

---

## 🛠️ Practice Plan

While I couldn’t implement a full pipeline in one day, I planned:

- Identify sample data sources (CSV, SQL tables).  
- Sketch an **ETL flow using SSIS** to transform and load data into a data warehouse table.  
- Plan to build a **basic SSAS cube** on this dataset for analysis.  
- Create a **paginated report with SSRS** on the processed dataset.

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- **MSBI** enables a complete **data pipeline from ingestion → analysis → reporting**.  
- Modular structure makes it flexible to handle **large-scale BI workflows**.  
- Learning MSBI is critical for **enterprise-level BI solutions** and career advancement in **data engineering and analytics**.
