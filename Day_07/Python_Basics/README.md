## What I Learned Today

### Python as a Calculator 🧮

```python
2 + 2        # 4
50 - 5*6     # 20
(50 - 5*6) / 4  # 5.0
8 / 5        # 1.6
17 // 3      # 5
17 % 3       # 2
2 ** 3       # 8
```

### Variables and Assignments 💾

```python
width = 20
height = 5 * 9
area = width * height  # 900
```

### Working with Strings 📜

```python
'spam eggs'
"doesn't"    
'''This is a 
multiline string.'''
```

### String Operations

```python
"py" + "thon"      # Concatenation
"python" * 3       # Repetition
```

### String Indexing and Slicing 🔍

```python
word = 'Python'
word[0]      # 'P'
word[-1]     # 'n'
word[0:2]    # 'Py'
word[2:]     # 'thon'      # Repetition
```

===========================================================================================

### 🧪 Practice Script Examples

```python
msg = 'Hello World'
print(msg)     # Repetition

print("Hello" + " " + "Day07")

print("Hello " + input("What is your name?") + "!")

name = input("What is your name?")
print(name)

name = "Frog"
length = len(name)
print(length)

```

### 🎸 Band Name Generator 🎵

```python
# random though that made a combo to generate a band name
print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator.")

city = input("Which city did you grow up in?\n")
pet = input("What is the name of your pet?\n")

print("Your band name could be: " + city + " " + pet)
```
